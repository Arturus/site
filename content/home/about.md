# About me
I'm an applied data scientist and machine learning engineer with a strong background
in a software engineering, large scale analytics and computer science.  

I was fascinated by computers and programming from the school years (early 90's). I
still remember how to program Z80 processor, if you understand what I'm
talking about.
  
My work spans the full spectrum from solving complex data science problems to 
 building petabyte-scale analytical systems that serve millions of users worldwide. 
I believe in the power of data to transform the world and
  pleased to take a part in this transformation.

I also have a passion for entrepreneurship and startups. I've built 
two successful startups by myself and helped teams to launch several others.
  
In my spare time I enjoy participating in Kaggle competitions and 
 recently won first place in a [time series forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting) competition.
